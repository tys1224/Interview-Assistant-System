# Interview-Assistant-System
	Aim : An interview assistant system for interviewer to evaluate the candidate through facial videos using deep learning \
	Big-Five Personality Prediction by deep learning \
	The truthfulness of the candidates' response by deep learning \
	Calculation of the matching points between the candidate and the company \
	Method :  \
	Use candidate’s self-introduction video to predict big-five personality with DAN model \
	Use candidate’s answering video to predict the truthfulness of the response using Convolutional Neural Network (VGG-Face) and LSTM \
	User Interface using Python, pyqt \
